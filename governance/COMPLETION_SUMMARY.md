# Governance System - Completion Summary

## ✅ All Tasks Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Created ✓

```
_tools/governance/
├── README.md                      # Complete usage documentation
├── governance-check.sh            # Master script - runs all validators
├── install-hooks.sh               # Installs pre-commit hook in projects
├── uninstall-hooks.sh             # Removes pre-commit hooks
└── validators/                    # Standalone validators
    ├── secrets-scanner.py         # Detects API keys and secrets
    └── absolute-path-check.py     # Detects hardcoded absolute paths
```

### 2. governance-check.sh Created ✓

**Features:**
- Accepts file list as arguments OR scans git staged files automatically
- Runs each validator using `$HOME/.local/bin/uv run`
- Exits with non-zero if ANY validator fails
- Clear color-coded output showing which validator failed
- Compatible with older bash versions (no bash 4+ dependencies)

**Exit codes:**
- `0`: All validators passed
- `1`: One or more validators failed

### 3. install-hooks.sh Created ✓

**Features:**
- Takes project path as argument (defaults to current directory)
- Verifies it's a git repository before installing
- Creates/overwrites `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Makes hook executable automatically
- Prints clear success message with configuration details

**Usage:**
```bash
./install-hooks.sh                    # Install in current directory
./install-hooks.sh /path/to/project   # Install in specific project
```

### 4. uninstall-hooks.sh Created ✓

**Features:**
- Removes pre-commit hook from specified project
- Safety check: verifies hook contains "governance" before removing
- Uses `trash` if available, falls back to `rm`
- Warns if non-governance hook detected

**Usage:**
```bash
./uninstall-hooks.sh                  # Uninstall from current directory
./uninstall-hooks.sh /path/to/project # Uninstall from specific project
```

### 5. Validators Copied and Adapted ✓

Both validators have been adapted from the Claude Code hook framework to work standalone:

#### secrets-scanner.py
- **Adapted to:** Accept file paths as command-line arguments
- **Returns:** Exit code 0 (pass) or 1 (fail)
- **Detects:**
  - OpenAI API keys (`sk-...`)
  - Anthropic API keys (`sk-ant-...`)
  - Google API keys (`AIza...`)
  - AWS credentials (`AKIA...`)
  - GitHub tokens (`ghp_...`, etc.)
  - Slack tokens (`xox...`)
  - Stripe keys
  - Discord bot tokens
  - Generic API key assignments

#### absolute-path-check.py
- **Adapted to:** Accept file paths as command-line arguments
- **Returns:** Exit code 0 (pass) or 1 (fail)
- **Detects:**
  - macOS user paths (`/Users/username/...`)
  - Linux user paths (`/home/username/...`)
  - Homebrew paths (`/opt/homebrew/...`)
  - Windows paths (`C:\Users\username\...`)

### 6. Testing Completed ✓

All tests passed successfully:

#### Test 1: Secrets Detection ✅
```bash
# Created file with hardcoded API key
API_KEY = "sk-proj-1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890ABCDEF"

# Result: BLOCKED ✓
🚨 POTENTIAL SECRETS DETECTED
File: bad_secrets.py
  - Generic API Key Assignment: API_KEY ...DEF"
✗ Governance checks failed - commit blocked
```

#### Test 2: Absolute Path Detection ✅
```bash
# Created file with hardcoded absolute path
data_dir = "/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/data"

# Result: BLOCKED ✓
🚫 HARDCODED ABSOLUTE PATHS DETECTED
File: bad_paths.py
  Line 4: data_dir = "/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/data"
✗ Governance checks failed - commit blocked
```

#### Test 3: Clean Code Passes ✅
```bash
# Created file with proper patterns
API_KEY = os.getenv('API_KEY')
data_dir = "./data"

# Result: PASSED ✓
Checking 1 file(s)...
Running secrets-scanner.py... ✓ PASS
Running absolute-path-check.py... ✓ PASS
✓ All governance checks passed
[main (root-commit) c2b135e] Test: this should pass all checks
```

#### Test 4: Uninstall Works ✅
```bash
# Ran uninstall script
./uninstall-hooks.sh

# Result: SUCCESS ✓
Uninstalling governance hooks from: /path/to/project
✓ Pre-commit hook moved to trash
```

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **governance-check.sh runs validators and reports pass/fail**
   - Color-coded output (green ✓ for pass, red ✗ for fail)
   - Clear error messages from validators
   - Proper exit codes (0 = pass, 1 = fail)

✅ **install-hooks.sh successfully installs pre-commit hook**
   - Verified in test project
   - Hook properly calls governance-check.sh
   - Made executable automatically

✅ **A bad commit (with secrets or absolute paths) is blocked**
   - Tested with fake API key → BLOCKED ✓
   - Tested with absolute path → BLOCKED ✓

✅ **A good commit passes through**
   - Tested with environment variables and relative paths → PASSED ✓

## Additional Features Implemented

Beyond the requirements, I also added:

1. **Comprehensive README.md** with:
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Customization instructions
   - Best practices

2. **Bash compatibility fixes**:
   - Replaced `mapfile` with portable alternative
   - Works on macOS default bash (3.2+)

3. **Safety features**:
   - Validator existence checks
   - Git repository verification
   - Non-governance hook protection in uninstall
   - Uses `trash` when available instead of `rm`

4. **Color-coded output**:
   - GREEN for success
   - RED for failures
   - YELLOW for warnings

## Rules Compliance

✅ **Used `trash` not `rm`** (with fallback for systems without trash)
✅ **Used `$HOME/.local/bin/uv run`** for all Python scripts
✅ **All scripts are executable** (`chmod +x` applied)
✅ **Clear usage instructions** in README.md

## File Locations

All files created in: `/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/_tools/governance/`

```
governance/
├── README.md (7.3KB)
├── governance-check.sh (2.2KB, executable)
├── install-hooks.sh (1.7KB, executable)

## Next Steps

The governance system is ready for production use. To deploy to other projects:

1. Navigate to a project: `cd /path/to/project`
2. Install hooks: `/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/_tools/governance/install-hooks.sh`
3. Test with a commit
4. To uninstall: `/Users/eriksjaastad/projects/_tools/governance/uninstall-hooks.sh`

## Notes

- The system is completely standalone and portable
- No dependencies on Claude Code hook framework
- Can be copied to other machines (just need `uv` installed)
- Easy to extend with new validators (see README.md)
