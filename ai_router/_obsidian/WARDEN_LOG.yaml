  action: "CLI Interface Implementation for AIRouter"
  changes:
    - Created `scripts/cli.py` to wrap `AIRouter` as a command-line tool.
    - Added support for `--prompt`, `--tier`, `--model`, and `--file` context injection.
    - Implemented exit code standards (0 for success, 1 for error).
    - Updated `00_Index_ai-router.md` to reflect the new executable script.
    - Verified script passes quality standards (type hints, path portability).
  warden_agent: "AI Router CLI implemented. Tool is now accessible via terminal."
