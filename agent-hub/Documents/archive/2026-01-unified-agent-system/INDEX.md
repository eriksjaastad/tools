## Why Archived

These documents represent the evolution of the agent-hub system through multiple design iterations. The current implementation is guided by:

1. **ROADMAP.md** — 7 phases, 11 weeks, "Absorb → Adapt → Build" strategy
2. **PRD_UNIFIED_AGENT_SYSTEM.md** — 25 functional requirements
3. **PHASE_0_PROMPTS.md** — Current phase prompts for floor manager

The archived documents remain valuable for understanding design decisions and historical context.
